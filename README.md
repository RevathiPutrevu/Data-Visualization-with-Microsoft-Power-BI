### Business Context

MovieLens is a company in the internet and entertainment domain with an online database of information related to films, television series, and online streaming content including cast, production crew, trivia, ratings, fan, and critical reviews. Every year in collaboration with a guest curator, MovieLens publish their annual insights based on a theme providing a comprehensive view of a topic. The company is planning to bring out the **Movie Talkies: Classic** edition this year. The idea is to connect with the viewers who have strong movie preferences as well as promote classic movies to attract new customers and expand their viewer base. 

### Objective

In order to create the **Movie Talkies: Classic** edition, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing and presenting the information about movies from a bygone era. The core issue is understanding the characteristics of these classic movies, user interests, and the relationship between user demographics and movie ratings. Without clear visuals, it is difficult to identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and engage the audience on a deeper level. 

As a Data Analyst, the goal is to create a comprehensive report that delivers an in-depth analysis of classic movies released up to the year 2000.

### Data Description

The dataset used for the analysis is a part of the [Data Analytics Essentials](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/data-analytics-essentials-online-course) certification course offered by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. The CSV files are available in the Dataset folder in the repository. 

### Solution Approach

**Data Preparation & Modeling:**
- Imported three CSV files into Microsoft Power BI
- Cleaned and transformed data by removing unnecessary columns, handling null values, and eliminating duplicates
- Optimized data model to prevent circular dependencies

**Key Metrics & Visualizations:**

- Used Card visuals for total movies, genres, and users
- Represented demographics with Donut charts (gender distribution) and Gauge charts (average ratings)
- Showcased trends using Stacked bar charts (genre releases) and Clustered column charts (user profiles)

**Grouping & Filtering for Insights:**

- Grouped similar genres (e.g., "Action-based," "Adventure-based")
- Created Decade-based and Age-group classifications
- Applied Slicers to filter by decade, genre, and occupation

**Interactivity & Advanced Analytics:**

- Implemented Treemaps, Scatterplots, and Matrix visuals for comparisons
- Enhanced navigation with Bookmarks and Buttons
- Leveraged **DAX** measures and calculated columns for deeper insights
